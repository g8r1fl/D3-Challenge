          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <h4>Poverty vs Obesity, Smoker & lack of healthcare</h4>
          <p>By looking at the chart there is definitely a correlation between poverty and the three health risk factors.  For each health risk factor vs poverty, 
            we see a trend increasing in percentage of obese, smokers and lack of healthcare as you move towards the higher percentiles of poverty levels.  
          </p>
          <p>The inverse is seen when you compare the same three health risk factors vs Median Household Income(MHI).  As the (MHI) increases, each of the three health risk factors decrease. </p>
          
          <h4>Age vs Obesity, Smoker & lack of healthcare</h4>

          <p>The data doesn't seem to show any correlation between <strong>age</strong> and <strong>lacks healthcare</strong> although, the majority of the sample are between the ages of 34-44.</p>

          <p>There does seem to show a slight correlation to smoking.  As age increases, there percentage of smokers seems to incrrease.</p>

          <p>Finally, there doesn't seem to be any correlation between <strong>age</strong> and <strong>obesity</strong> .</p>
